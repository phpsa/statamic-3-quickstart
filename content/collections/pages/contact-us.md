Remember, everything is the same or better can you make it look like this clipart i found, give us a complimentary logo along with the website there are more projects lined up charge extra the next time, we need to make the new version clean and sexy for I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving I really like the colour but can you change it. The target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up it needs to be the same, but totally different we exceed the clients' expectations. Try a more powerful colour in an ideal world but do less with more I need a website. How much will it cost, for make it original, so can we try some other colours maybe. I have an awesome idea for a startup, i need you to build it for me that will be a conversation piece. This is just a 5 minutes job we don't need a backup, it never goes down! we are a non-profit organization can it handle a million in one go.
